### 🫁 DL Final Project - Lung Cancer Classification
This project aims to classify lung cancer images into 'Benign,' 'Malignant,' and 'Normal' categories using deep learning techniques. A CNN-based model was implemented, with transfer learning used to boost accuracy. Data preprocessing, including normalization and augmentation, enhanced model performance. The CNN model achieved 99% accuracy, while transfer learning reached 100%. The project also explored techniques such as SMOTE for class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning. Future improvements include testing advanced architectures and deploying the model for real-time diagnosis.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, CNN

### 🎯 Machine Learning Assignment Project - Breast Cancer Classification
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer masses as either malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes 569 instances with 30 numeric features related to cell characteristics. Data preprocessing and feature selection techniques were applied to improve model performance. Several algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The project evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective classification of cancer types.

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
