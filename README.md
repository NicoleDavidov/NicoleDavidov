# üí° My Projects

### üíª Cost Manager Server
The Cost Manager Server is the backend component of the Cost Manager App. It provides a RESTful API that allows users to manage their personal expenses by supporting operations such as adding cost items, retrieving user details, generating monthly reports, and returning developer information. The backend is fully integrated with MongoDB and deployed on Render.

**Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Python (for testing), JSDoc (for documentation)

**GitHub Repo:** [Cost Manager Server](https://github.com/NicoleDavidov/CostManagerServerSide)


### üíµ Cost Manager App
The Cost Manager App is a personal finance management tool designed to help users efficiently track their expenses and incomes. The app allows users to filter data by month, year, and category, and provides visual reports through pie charts for better financial decision-making. Built using modern web technologies, the app offers an intuitive user interface for managing finances effectively.

**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS.

### üß† Study Buddy ‚Äì AWS Hackathon Demo
Study Buddy is an interactive chatbot demo developed as part of an internal AWS-focused hackathon at HIT ‚Äì Holon Institute of Technology.
The project simulates a smart academic assistant that detects a student's grade decline and provides personalized support like study recommendations and lecture summaries.
The system is built using React and Tailwind CSS and demonstrates how AWS tools like Amazon S3, Transcribe, and Bedrock could be integrated in a full system.

**Technologies:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, Babel

**Conceptual AWS Tools:** Amazon S3, Transcribe, Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Amazon Lex

**Demo:** [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9B5jRm6vPm8)

### ü´Å DL Final Project - Lung Cancer Classification
This project aims to classify lung cancer images into 'Benign,' 'Malignant,' and 'Normal' categories using deep learning techniques. A CNN-based model was implemented, with transfer learning used to boost accuracy. Data preprocessing, including normalization and augmentation, enhanced model performance. The CNN model achieved 99% accuracy, while transfer learning reached 100%. The project also explored techniques such as SMOTE for class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning. Future improvements include testing advanced architectures and deploying the model for real-time diagnosis.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, CNN

### üéØ Machine Learning Assignment Project - Breast Cancer Classification
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer masses as either malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes 569 instances with 30 numeric features related to cell characteristics. Data preprocessing and feature selection techniques were applied to improve model performance. Several algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The project evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective classification of cancer types.

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
